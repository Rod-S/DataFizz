Once your solution is completed please add an EXTENSIONS.txt file to your solution
that notes how your application could be extended to handle the following:

1. Domains beyond Amazon.com
2. Products beyond just simply books.

1.
  -This crawling application can be extended to domains beyond Amazon.com by
    changing the 'domain' and 'path' variables declared at the beginning.
  -Additional class constructors along with the respective selectors for each
    object/data point would need to be created.
  -Depending on the web domain, if HTML cannot be retrieved without authentication
    or if the domain has anti-scraping measures in place, headers can be included
    in the request options along with proxy server connections.
2.
  -The application partially supports other objects searchable through amazon.
    For the sake of clarity, not all selectors for "other" products were included,
    though if the path variable is changed from '/books' to '/electronics',
    name data and price scraped from the electronics route is displayed in the JSON file.
  -Though multiple classes were declared for each of the different types of book media,
    it may be simpler to declare fewer objects but with multiple selector conditions to
    create an object with. For instance, the 'Other' Class in the application had
    the OR || operator to choose between the 2 different selector options from books
    and electronics
    -The choice would depend upon the situation and how many types of product options
    are within each category type.
